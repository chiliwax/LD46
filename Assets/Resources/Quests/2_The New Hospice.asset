  description: '"Our hospice has just opened and we have the most competent doctors,
    unfortunately our patients tend to scream when they are given extensive care.
    Would it be possible to order two sleeping bandages and a blood thinning potion
    ? Please !"

    

    I must have some bandages lying on the right side of
    the stove and I have Yellone herbs for their potion. In my opinion it is mostly
    morphine and gags that they would need. But it''s not my business!'
