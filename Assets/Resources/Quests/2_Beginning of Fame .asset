  description: '"I heard about you at the castle, it seems that your remedies are
    miraculous ! I have a resale store in town, would you like to send me 4 potions
    and 4 soothing balms? I promise to practice affordable prices for the poors.
    If it works, we will discuss about a long-term arrangement!"

    -Daniel, bargain
    merchant

    

    It''s a big order but why not?

    I have honey for the
    balms and alcohol for the potions. Let''s add something for the pain and we''re
    good. Why is my butt starting to tickle?'
