    A worried sailor.


    I hope it''s not just for drinking and trying to avoid
    a hangover, because obviously it wouldn''t work. The master has been telling
    them to drink water for years. But after all, since they pay me, that doesn''t
    concern me. Well, I have all the ingredients on my desk, I just have to get started!'
